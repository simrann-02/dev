1. what is html?
  hypertext markup language - 
  hypertext - a link to another page/same page
  markup - a syntax using tags and attributes - marks up the plain text

2. How web works?
  client server architecture - client requests a service, the server responds. uses http to communicate
  http 
  a simple http request contains  - 
  GET /index.html HTTP/1.1  - request line 

  Host: leetcode.com
  Accept-language - en-us
  Content-type - application/json

  Body - json

  a simple http response contains -
  HTTP/1.1 200
  Date
  content-type - html

  Body

  Once the browser recieves the response, it contructs a DOM - basically it represents the objects/elements of our application

  it reads the references to other resources like images/fonts etc - a separate request is sent for each url to its corresponding server.

  once the browser has all the necessary resources, it renders the document.
